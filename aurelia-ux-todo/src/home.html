        <h2 styles.header>What is Aurelia UX?</h2>

        <p styles.description>
            Aurelia UX is a companion framework to Aurelia. While Aurelia focuses on being
            a <em>front-end framework</em> by providing core capabilities you need to build apps, such as templating, binding and routing,
            Aurelia UX focuses on being a <em>user experience framework</em> by providing
            higher-level capabilities such as design languages, theming and components.
        </p>

        <p styles.description>
            Aurelia UX is still in a very early stage but we'd love for you to play with it
            and consider contributing. We'll keep this app updated as we add new features
            so it's easy for you to track our progress.
