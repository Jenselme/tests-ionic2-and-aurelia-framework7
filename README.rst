This repository contains my comparison of Ionic2/Angular2 and Aurelia/Framework7
to build mobile hybrid applications. The ionic2 app is in the *ionic2-todo*
folder and the Aurelia app is in *aurelia-f7-todo*. Both applications are basic
todo list applications that can:

- List all the saved todos (home page)
- Edit an existing todo
- Add a todo
- Mark a todo as done on the home page. Done todos must have their title
  strike-through on the home page.

All todos must be stored in the permanent SqlStorage of the phone.

In additions to these features, both applications must work on a browser (for
debug and development purposes), on an android emulator and on an android
phone.

See the README file in each subfolder to know how to launch and install the
applications and what features they have.
